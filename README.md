# Whack-A-Mole (in Swift)

This Sunday (& a bit of Monday morning), I decided I wanted to learn a bit of Swift and make something for the Swift Student Challenge. I built a very barebones Whack-A-Mole game (inspired by @zrlâ€™s #whack-a-mole on the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack)) and had a lot fun learning the language.
